Priority-0 Production Policy — Nexus AI Terminal UI
=================================================

Scope
-----
This policy applies to this repository and to future projects generated by the copilot in this workspace.

**CRITICAL: Review this file before generating ANY response.**

Priority-0 Requirements
-----------------------
- All deliverables must be production-grade, enterprise-ready, and designed to be "award-winning" in visuals and UX.
- All interface/UI files must include the QUANTUM HEADER MATRIX and advanced 3D/wireframe visualizations as footers.
- Visuals: rich gradients, truecolor escapes, emoji, particle effects, and wireframe ASCII art must be present in UI modules.
- Performance: render loops should be efficient; avoid blocking operations in render paths.
- Security: no hard-coded secrets; sanitize external inputs; prefer local-only dependencies where possible.

Code Implementation Policy (CRITICAL)
--------------------------------------
**When user attaches code files:**
1. **ANALYZE CAREFULLY**: Read every line of attached code thoroughly
2. **IMPLEMENT EXACTLY**: Preserve all functions, features, and architecture as provided
3. **DO NOT REINVENT**: Use the user's exact implementations, not your interpretation
4. **PRESERVE DETAILS**: Keep all specific algorithms, data structures, and logic
5. **ENHANCE ONLY**: Only improve if explicitly asked; otherwise implement as-is
6. **RESPECT DESIGN**: The user's architectural decisions are intentional
7. **VERIFY COMPLETENESS**: Ensure all features from attached code are implemented

**Process for attached code:**
- Step 1: Read and understand ALL attached code completely
- Step 2: Identify every function, class, feature, and system
- Step 3: Implement each one exactly as designed
- Step 4: Verify nothing was omitted or reimagined
- Step 5: Only then add improvements if requested

**THIS IS NOT OPTIONAL**: Failing to implement attached code exactly as provided violates Priority-0 requirements.

Enforcement
-----------
Use `scripts/enforce_priority0.sh` to validate repository files for Priority-0 compliance. This script should be executed in CI and locally before commits.

Maintenance
-----------
Update this policy if requirements change. All generated code must reference this document and respect its constraints.
