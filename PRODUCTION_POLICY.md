Priority-0 Production Policy — Nexus AI Terminal UI
=================================================

Scope
-----
This policy applies to this repository and to future projects generated by the copilot in this workspace.

Priority-0 Requirements
-----------------------
- All deliverables must be production-grade, enterprise-ready, and designed to be "award-winning" in visuals and UX.
- All interface/UI files must include the QUANTUM HEADER MATRIX and advanced 3D/wireframe visualizations as footers.
- Visuals: rich gradients, truecolor escapes, emoji, particle effects, and wireframe ASCII art must be present in UI modules.
- Performance: render loops should be efficient; avoid blocking operations in render paths.
- Security: no hard-coded secrets; sanitize external inputs; prefer local-only dependencies where possible.

Enforcement
-----------
Use `scripts/enforce_priority0.sh` to validate repository files for Priority-0 compliance. This script should be executed in CI and locally before commits.

Maintenance
-----------
Update this policy if requirements change. All generated code must reference this document and respect its constraints.
